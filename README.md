# Burger
- A app that allows a user to create a burger, add it to the database and html page, as well as update the created burger once it has been eaten (devoured). 

## Getting Started

- Create the following files inside of burger folder: 
    * .gitignore
    * config (folder)
      * connection.js
      * orm.js
    * controllers (folder)
        - burgers_controllers.js
    * db (folder)
        - schema.sql
        - seeds.sql
    * models
        - burger.js
    * node_modules (.gitignore)
    * package.json
    * public (folder)
        - (to be created at a later date)
      * views (folder)
        - index.handlebars
        - layouts (folder)
            - main.handlebars
    * node_modules 
    * package.json
